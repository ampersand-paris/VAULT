She formed Bebe Miller Company in 1985 to pursue her interest in finding a physical language for the human condition. She has collaborated with artists, composers, writers and designers along with the dancers who share her studio practice and from whom she has learned what dancing can reveal. The company has toured widely across the country and in Europe, South America, Asia and Africa. Her choreography has been performed by Kyle Abraham’s A.I.M., Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, Oregon Ballet Theater, Boston Ballet, Philadanco, the UK’s Phoenix Dance Company and PACT Dance Company of Johannesburg, South Africa. Over the last decade the Company has produced a variety of digital archive projects that share the company’s creative practice with artists and audiences. Named a Master of African American Choreography by the Kennedy Center in 2005, she has received four New York Dance and Performance “Bessie” awards, the David R. White Award from New York Live Arts, United States Artists and Guggenheim Fellowships, honorary doctorates from Ursinus College and Franklin & Marshall College, and a Doris Duke Artist Award. Bebe is a Professor Emerita in The Ohio State University’s Department of Dance and lives in Columbus, OH.</p>
