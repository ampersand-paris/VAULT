                    <p className="no-top-padding">Somatically driven, <a href="https://www.khecari.org/jonathan-meyer">Jonathan Meyer</a> works to develop an idiosyncratic movement palette blurring grace and awkwardness, building strange lands that can delight, baffle, and open new possibilities. Meyer has danced for The High Risk Group, Pierre-Paul Savoie, Asimina Chremos, and The Seldoms. Meyer has also worked with at-risk youth in wilderness therapy programs in Utah teaching primitive skills, and is a Certified Practitioner of Body-Mind CenteringÂ®. In 2002 Meyer founded Khecari in Taos, NM. In 2006, Meyer moved Khecari to Chicago, and shortly thereafter he began his intensive collaboration and partnership with Julia Rae Antonick, with whom he runs the company.</p>
