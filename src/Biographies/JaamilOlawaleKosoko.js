Kosoko's creative practice draws from Black study and queer theories of the body, weaving together visual performance, lecture, ritual, and spiritual practice. Their most recent work, Chameleon (The Living Installments), premiered virtually in April 2020. His previous works: Séancers (2017) and the “Bessie”-nominated #negrophobia (2015), have toured internationally. He teaches regularly at Princeton University.</p>
