                    <p>Our company has created an archive of the music of all of its works and is in the process of doing the same for its video performances. As technology has evolved over time I have found Youtube to be a relative source for archiving videos. These videos have been used to teach new dancers original choreography of our company repertoire. We have had some videographers transfer previous videos to digital media to make it convenient, however there are older VHS videos that have not been converted. At public performances such as a summer festival we find that numerous videos appear on social media. Music is easier than videos because standard songs can easily be found using a variety of sources such as Apple, Google or Spotify. Original arrangements however have been saved on computers, drives and converted appropriately over time.</p>
                    <p><b>How has (your) dance making been affected (or not) by the virtual/digital availability of your work?</b></p>
                    <p>In cases where previous works inspire new works I can say that my dance making has been affected. This availability provides easy access for study and reflection of a work. This also affects the continuation of how the work is passed on and presented. The media can be used to communicate the principal to new dancers that would perform the work for a better understanding and or discussion simply by sending and viewing. Critique and reflection of a work has been made easy because dancers can have immediate access to a video once they finish performing.</p>
                    <p><b>What do you assume (in the best sense of the word) about audience and your practice?</b></p>
                    <p>The audience is always “moved” by a work they see from the style of choreography from myself or any of the choreographers in the company. We intentionally choreograph with this intention and select movement and songs to mirror the concept of the name of the company Move Me Soul.</p>
                    <p><b>What are some changes imaginable regarding company/independent artist strategies, audiences, funding and presenting structures?</b></p>
                    <p>Funding is essential to all of the other listed above. As we receive funding for the company I anticipate a transition from a group of independently contracted artists to full time company members. Although our company members are very committed this transition will present opportunity for structure changes as well as a greater establishment of the following performer repoire and consistency, marketing of concerts and premiere of works and its content resulting in an increase in audience and their understanding of the works and strategic planning for the next phases of the company.</p>
