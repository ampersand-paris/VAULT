The immediacy of the archive now—broadcast it, be done with it, let it be absorbed into the artistic mindset of the culture—even at the beginning of conceiving of the idea/event/artwork. In that difference between the vertical and horizontal, on a fascial/body level, is there a difference in the work we make, do we need to support both axes or yet a new direction?</p>

                        <p><b>Ann Carlson, NYC:</b></p> <p>The search for the right word [...] is interesting. “Archiving is really not quite right….” What I hear in the search for the word, and also in the fascia, is value; trapping, mapping understanding value. You’re also immediately saying ‘the lifetime of this effort that I’m putting out in the world, what is its resonance?” I love the looking for the word that is the thing, the embodied connection…what is fascia? It changes, responds differently between body and bone, it’s self-supporting… Something about the word resonant, resonant meaning perhaps – what we are, what we do… I love the reach for the word. The horizontal and vertical thing, it’s the present-moment awareness that the song will keep going.</p>
